# JetsProject

Welcome to the Jets Project. To initialize the project:
1)Download the files src/com/skilldistillery/jets directory. 
2)Open the file in a text editor or IDE of your choice. 
3)Compile and run the program. 
4)Follow the program prompts.

# Description

This project allows a user to display an array list of pre-generated jets of different types. The types of jets in this project are civilian jets, military jets, and space jets. When the user decides to display the jet, relevant information is seen by the user about the jet, such as the model, year produced, and purpose of the jet in question. The user can then apply behaviors using interfaces to those objects such as flying a jet or a systems check. The user can also add or remove jets to the airfield depending on the type of jet they would like to add, such as military, space, or civilian jet. 

# Technology Used

Eclipse IDE was used to create the program.

# Lessons Learned

I learned how to use classes, superclasses, subclasses, and interfaces in this project. I also learned how to use class object and wrapper functions in a program. I learned how to refactor and optimize a program to prevent stack overflow. I also how to learn utilize array lists and instances-of functions in a program.
